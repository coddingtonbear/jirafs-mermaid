Jirafs-Mermaid
==============

Automatically converts mermaid chart definitions into images that will
be uploaded in-place to Jira on your behalf.

Use
---

You can enter a mermaid diagram into your document by using the ``mermaid`` macro::

   <jirafs:mermaid>
    sequenceDiagram
        Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
        John-->>Alice: Great!
   </jirafs:mermaid>

or::

    <jirafs:mermaid src="name-of-mermaid-file.mmd" />

Upon submission to Jira, a file will automatically be generated, and your markup will be replaced with an embedded image showing your rendered image.

Options
-------

You can control the type and characteristics of the image generated by specifying
any of the following attributes:

* `src`: Use the referenced file for your mermaid digram's contents.  Note that this
  cannot be specified if digram contents are specified directly in your
  tag's contents.
* `theme`: (Default: 'default') Which mermaid theme to use.
  See `mermaid.cli -h` for what versions your version of mermaid supports.
* `format`: (Default: `png`) File format to generate.

1. Install from PIP::

    pip install jirafs-mermaid

2. Enable for a ticket folder::

Note that you can globally enable this (or any) plugin by adding the
